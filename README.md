# Vehicle Damage Detection System

An AI-powered web application for automatic vehicle damage detection using **YOLOv8** and **Streamlit**. The system identifies different types of vehicle damage from uploaded images, estimates repair costs based on detected severity, and generates a detailed inspection report.

* Supports image upload (JPG, JPEG, PNG)
* Adjustable detection confidence threshold
* Damage severity assessment
* Estimated repair cost calculation
* Interactive Streamlit web interface
* Automatic inspection report generation
* Downloadable damage assessment report
